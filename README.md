### Project Overview

This dashboard was created to help Tikky Tech understand its employees better. It brings together important HR information like age, gender, job roles, departments, locations, and diversity, and presents it in one easy-to-read place. With this dashboard, managers can quickly see how many people work in each department, where employees are located, and which job roles are most common. 

It also highlights important patterns, such as the company’s strong focus on engineering, the high number of remote workers, and the concentration of employees in certain states. Overall, the goal of the project is to turn raw employee data into clear insights that can help the company make better decisions about hiring, diversity, workforce planning, and general HR strategy.

### Observations

Based on the analytics, these are some observation:

#### 1. Dashboard Design Observations:
 - The dashboard has a consistent dark-green theme which gives it a branded look.
 - Metrics are grouped logically:
   Demographics → Departments → Locations → Job Titles → Race → States → Cities.
 - The use of cards, bar charts, donut charts, treemaps, and KPIs increases variety and readability.
 - KPI cards (Total Employees, Job Titles, Departments, States, Cities) are clearly displayed.

#### 2. Data Quality Observations:
 - Age groups show uneven distribution—most employees appear to be in 25–54.
 - Location distribution (16K remote vs 5K HQ) suggests a heavily remote workforce.
 - Ohio dominates the states chart heavily.
   → Likely a major employment hub.

### Recommendations

Based on the analytics, these are some recommendations:

#### 1. Improve Workforce Distribution & Hiring Strategy: 
 - Strengthen hiring efforts in understaffed departments such as Sales and Quality Control to balance work capacity.
 - Since most employees fall within 25–54 age range, introduce graduate trainee programs to attract younger talent (18–24).
 - Consider succession planning for older age groups (55+) to avoid future skill gaps.

#### 2. Optimize Remote vs On-Site Workforce:
 - With 75% of employees working remotely, invest in:
    - Remote collaboration tools.
    - Cybersecurity infrastructure.
    - Virtual training programs.
 - Conduct a hybrid performance study to compare productivity of remote vs HQ workers.

#### 3. Enhance Diversity & Inclusion Programs:
 - Racial representation appears imbalanced (White group dominates).
  - Introduce targeted recruitment for underrepresented groups.
  - Roll out DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) training company-wide.

#### 4. Review State-Level Workforce Allocation
 - Ohio has a disproportionately high count of employees.
 - Evaluate if this concentration creates operational risk
 
#### 5. Strengthen Job Title Structure:
 - The company has 185 job titles, which is unusually high.
    - Conduct a job role consolidation exercise.
    - Streamline similar roles to reduce complexity and improve HR operations.
  
#### 6. Workforce Planning & Talent Management:
 - Departments with high workload (Engineering, Research) should be assessed for burnout risk.
 - Implement training and development programs to upskill lower-level developers into higher positions.
